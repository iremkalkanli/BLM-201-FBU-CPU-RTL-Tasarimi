# RTL Design of FB CPU

RTL design with 10 operation codes developed in verilog language on the FPGA </br>
It is the design of the FB-CPU on the FPGA, whose circuit design has been developed before
## Results

We learned how to perform this CPU design, which we developed machine language before, with verilog language. </br>
Thanks to this project, we learned about how to transition from a system with a circuit design to an FPGA design.
